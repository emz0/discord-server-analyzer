Why not I'm allowed to say whatever I wnat want* that's called freedom of speech or You are like social media, You disallow this XD well, thats the reason you arent getting higher lvl, admins on jh are supposed to help people and not calling them something they might not be, whcih could be insulting to them also I didn't use word terrorist another lie iraq guy asked for help, i helped him and then you asked me why am i helping a terrorist it was vissible in cod2 channel and clay saw it hm. maybe. i believe the logic behind this is if you are higher level than usual (60+), you are suppose to be nice to people and helping them, etc. not being racist OR hurting their feelings. because if you are 60+ you are trusted with a server control therefore there are people who are trusting you. help him plant the bomb in czech republic! i was never and i never will be against you XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD but i also dont want innocent people who want to jump to be abused Europe balances the right to free expression with the right to be free of offense, meaning your right to speak is limited by speech that I might reasonably take as offensive. if he is innocent You're not the 1 who caused You to be 200kg+ k XD OH MY GOD GUYS KEEP GOING PLEASE IM ENJOYING THIS SO MUCH np inb4 thats what she said CMON I GOR GOT do you have crusti croc? basem finished real_autist now its your turn okay im going to have dinner but when im back, i want there to still be drama ok? honestly. radek.

I fignore them lol and what do they do to offend you? they exist? they believe in killing people? you cant know what a random guy believes in if he is from iraq, he is muslim if he is muslim, he believe in killing people Trela hell no fuck trela i really need AN OFFICIAL statement thats because all christians wait till marriage to have sex. of what you just said maybe if he is member of ISIS limited go to orban and tell him they are cool and you want 1 in your house You know nothign about orban ill go to fucking orban and tell him i want one in my server k xDDDD Orban hates them Quran Quran (2:191-193) - And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or unrest] is worse than killing... but if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful. And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah] and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun(the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.) (Translation is from the Noble Quran) The verse prior to this (190) refers to fighting for the cause of Allah those who fight you leading some to claim that the entire passage refers to a defensive war in which Muslims are defending their homes and families.  The historical context of this passage is not defensive warfare, however, since Muhammad and his Muslims had just relocated to Medina and were not under attack by their Meccan adversaries.  In fact, the verses urge offensive warfare, in that Muslims are to drive Meccans out of their own city (which they later did).  Verse 190 thus means to fight those who offer resistance to Allah's rule (ie. Muslim conquest).  The use of the word persecution by some Muslim translators is disingenuous - the actual Arabic words for persecution (idtihad) - and oppression are not used instead of fitna.  Fitna can mean disbelief, or the disorder that results from unbelief or temptation.  A strict translation is 'sedition,' meaning rebellion against authority (the authority being Allah).  This is certainly what is meant in this context since the violence is explicitly commissioned until religion is for Allah - ie. unbelievers desist in their unbelief.  [Editor's note: these notes have been modified slightly after a critic misinterpreted our language. Verse 193 plainly says that 'fighting' is sanctioned even if the fitna 'ceases'.  This is about religious order, not real persecution.] have fun hitler was atheist. ANd a good painter i dont need to quote his ideology here i hope. ye, and You love them limited, so go for a conversation with him you're basically quoting bible verses here trela. Who said I love the terrorists? which are about as bad as quran ones there is a big space between hating and loving trela.

Hard to not belive in yourself lol. believe* trela u didnt notes that u talk too much about muslims and say some shit about them ? i am serious do you believe in the christian god trela? do you believe in real God. christian god yes. Using those types of stories without context would be like saying that the United States is a racist/genocidal country because they bombed Japan in 1945, killing 250,000 people. The statement that they bombed Japan is true, but there's a whole context (a preceding global war that lasted 6 years) that it needs to be considered in the context of. how can I believe in 1 person which was walking on the water Izno please that was his son you dont even know christian religion how can you judge muslims so you dont believe in christian god BUT you believe in Quran which is basically an islam bible cause I don't care about this religion I don't believe in this, these retards believe that's why they kill people GEEZOS one min son of god ? wtf lol basem, as a muslim, do you belive in killing people? as a muslim k ISIS presents ISLAM in their way . and thats what u see thats what media wants us to believe. thats not even islam its disgreace im giving up on trela. he really wants to see this stuff his way, and there is no way to change his mind, \"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 2\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0msentiment\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0ms\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m",

And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or unrest] is worse than killing... but if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful. And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah] and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun(the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.) (Translation is from the Noble Quran) The verse prior to this (190) refers to fighting for the cause of Allah those who fight you leading some to claim that the entire passage refers to a defensive war in which Muslims are defending their homes and families.  The historical context of this passage is not defensive warfare, however, since Muhammad and his Muslims had just relocated to Medina and were not under attack by their Meccan adversaries.  In fact, the verses urge offensive warfare, in that Muslims are to drive Meccans out of their own city (which they later did).  Verse 190 thus means to fight those who offer resistance to Allah's rule (ie. Muslim conquest).  The use of the word persecution by some Muslim translators is disingenuous - the actual Arabic words for persecution (idtihad) - and oppression are not used instead of fitna.  Fitna can mean disbelief, or the disorder that results from unbelief or temptation.  A strict translation is 'sedition,' meaning rebellion against authority (the authority being Allah).  This is certainly what is meant in this context since the violence is explicitly commissioned until religion is for Allah - ie. unbelievers desist in their unbelief.  [Editor's note: these notes have been modified slightly after a critic misinterpreted our language. Verse 193 plainly says that 'fighting' is sanctioned even if the fitna 'ceases'.  This is about religious order, not real persecution.] have fun hitler was atheist. ANd a good painter i dont need to quote his ideology here i hope. ye, and You love them limited, so go for a conversation with him you're basically quoting bible verses here trela.
